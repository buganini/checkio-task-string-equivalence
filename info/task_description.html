    In Unicode, a glyph can be represented differently in binary form with only one way to check the equivalence.
</p>

<p>
    Due to historical reasons, some glyphs were brought into Unicode multiple times with similar or different forms and
    with this, the problem of equivalence emerged.
</p>

    Canonical equivalence cases defined in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/">UAX #15</a>.
    You should write a function that checks the equivalence for two strings.
</p>

<p>
    Canonical equivalent glyphs must be mutually exchangeable under any circumstance; so the Cyrillic "A" is not
    equivalent to Latin "A".
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments as strings (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Are they equivalent or not as a boolean.
</p>

    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio(u"\u212B", u"\u00C5") == True
checkio(u"\u212B", u"A") == False
checkio("q\u0323\u0307", "q\u0307\u0323") == True

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    If you are making a social platform and want to have unique user-names but without restricting users to Latin
    characters, this is a concept you should know about.
